Bean Machine Simulation

This is a Bean Machine Simulation that makes use of Processing Java Applet. The bottom row keeps track of how many beans have landed in each slot, with each slot becoming darker for every bean which lands in it.

This is a project uses an older version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/luna/sr2/eclipse-ide-java-developers) as well as [Java 8](https://www.java.com/en/download/).
